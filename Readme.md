# Image Caption Generator.

Image caption generation is a task in artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision that involves generating textual descriptions or captions for images automatically. The goal is to create a system that can understand the content of an image and express it in natural language. The process typically involves combining techniques from computer vision, which extracts features and information from the image, and natural language processing (NLP), which generates the textual description. Here's a general overview of how image caption generation works:
